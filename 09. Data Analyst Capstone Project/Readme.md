## Summary

This capstone Project course will give one the the opportunity to practice the work that Data Analysts do in an increasingly data-centric world of everchanging technologies. As part of a capstone project, I took on the role of a Data Analyst with the Global IT and Business Consulting Services Firm to assist with data collection, web scraping, exploration, data wrangling, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, and data visualization of several datasets obtained from various sources to help identify trends for the Current & Future yearâ€™s report on emerging technologies and skills. An Interactive Dashboard with IBM Cognos or Google Looker Studio were created to help analysis & presentation of the data dynamically. Finally, storytelling skills were used to provide a narrative & present the findings of the analysis to job recruiters, 
job seekers, tech innovators, employers, executives & professionals in the company. 

## Weekly Tasks

### Data Collection

* The data was collected from several datasets (such as Stack Overflow Survey, Github job postings), web scraped and then explored.

### Data Wrangling

* The data was then wrangled to remove duplicates & impute missing values from the survey dataset, and the cleaned data was normalized.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

* The wrangled data was subjected to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to determine the distribution of the normalized data, and to detect and remove outliers from the survey dataset.

###  Data Visualization

* Various charts were plotted to visualize the distribution, interesting relationships between features, composition and comparison of the data.

### Building a Dashboard

* IBM Cognos was employed to create interactive dashboards to help analyze & present the data dynamically.

### Presentation of Insights

* Storytelling skills were used to provide a narrative & present data-driven insights dynamically.
