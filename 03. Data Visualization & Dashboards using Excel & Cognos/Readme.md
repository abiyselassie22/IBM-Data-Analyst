# Data Visualization and Dashboards using Excel & Cognos

## Summary

This course introduces the basics of visualizing data with Excel & IBM Cognos Analytics without having to write any code. It begins with creating basic or simple charts such as line, pie & bar charts using Excel; then keeps on creating more advanced visualizations with Treemaps, Scatter Charts, Histograms, Filled Map Charts and Sparklines; and goes on working with the Excel PivotChart feature & several visualizations in an Excel dashboard. The course also teaches one how to use Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Cognos Analytics to create interactive dashboards, which play an important role in telling a data-driven story & communicating the data analysis findings. The course provides numerous hands-on labs to help us develop practical experience for working with Excel & Cognos. The Final Project will allow us to create a set of data visualizations & an interactive dashboard. I assumed to be a data scientist hired by SwiftAuto Traders (a chain of car dealerships), and was tasked to analyze car sales and profits for each dealer. I needed to create some visualizations and present them as a dashboard or report to my Regional Manager for better understanding on car sales and profits for each dealer. My objective was to analyze the historical trends in car sales for SwiftAuto Traders with the goal of providing insights on car sales & profits for each dealer.
