# Generative AI: Enhance Data Analytics Career

## Summary
This course clarifies the various potentials of Generative AI in Data Analytics. It provides an in-depth knowledge of the fundamental concepts, models, tools and Generative AI applications regarding the Data Analytics landscape. It demonstrates how to use Generative AI tools or frameworks or platforms to increase the effectiveness of various processes involved in the data analytics life cycle. It teaches how to use prompts and apply Generative models for tasks such as data generation, data augmentation, data preparation, finding insights, querying databases, generating visualizations & storytelling. It also explores challenges, ethical implications & considerations associated with using Generative AI in data analytics across different industries. One will acquire practical experience through various hands-on labs where one leverages Generative AI models & tools such as ChatGPT, ChatCSV, Mostly.ai, SQLthroughAI, DataRobot, Akkio, etc. In the Final Guided Practice Project, I took on the role of a data analyst for a Healthcare consultancy firm with a major task to produce a report to find out whether there are demographic, regional, and/or economic characteristics that lead to a better life. Specific tasks assigned to the role were to check the correctness of the data types in the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis to draw keen insights on the data, create a dashboard with at least 4 visualizations, and finally generate the narrative to present the dashboard.
