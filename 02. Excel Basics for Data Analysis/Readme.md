# Excel Basics for Data Analysis

## Summary

This course gives a basic working knowledge of Excel and how to use it for analyzing data. It introduces one to spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel & Google sheets, and shows one how to load data from multiple formats. It teaches how to perform basic data wrangling and cleansing tasks using functions, and expand one's knowledge of data analysis through the use of filtering, sorting, and pivot tables. It gives an opportunity to manipulate data and hands-on experience using Excel. It teaches how to clean and format data efficiently, and convert it to a pivot table to make it more organized & readable. The Final Project will allow one to showcase one's newly acquired data analysis skills by working with real datasets & spreadsheets. I took the role of a recently hired Junior Data Analyst in a local government office, and was tasked with sorting & analyzing Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory data that had been previously imported & cleaned. I used pivot tables to analyze the data in preparation for the results to be visualized in a dashboard & added to the data findings report later.
