# Data Visualization with Python

## Summary
This course teaches how to create meaningful, effective, and aesthetically pleasing data visuals (various types of basic & advanced graphs & charts) in Python using Matplotlib & other libraries such as Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & dash. It teaches the many ways of working with various data visualization tools & techniques to effetively visualize both small-scale & large-scale data. One will learn how to create interactive dashboards that allow even those without data analyst experience to better understand data, and make more effective & informed decisions. One will also complete numerous hands-on labs and a Final Project to practice & apply the many aspects & techniques of Data visualization using Jupyter Notebooks & cloud-based IDE. In the Final assignment, I took a role of a data scientist with a primary task to analyze the historical data and give the company directors insights on how the sales were affected during times of recession; and then provide a number of charts or plots to visualize the data and make it easy for the directors to understand my analysis.
