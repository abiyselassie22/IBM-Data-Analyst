# Data Visualization with Python

## Summary
This course teaches how to create meaningful, effective, and aesthetically pleasing data visuals (various types of basic & advanced graphs & charts) in Python using Matplotlib & other libraries such as Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & dash. It teaches the many ways of working with various data visualization tools & techniques to effetively visualize both small-scale & large-scale data. One will learn how to create interactive dashboards that allow even those without data analyst experience to better understand data, and make more effective & informed decisions. One will also complete numerous hands-on labs and a Final Project to practice & apply the many aspects & techniques of Data visualization using Jupyter Notebooks & cloud-based IDE. In the Final assignment, I took a role of a data scientist with a primary task to analyze the historical trends in automobile sales (of XYZAutomotives) during recession periods and give the company directors insights on how the sales were affected during times of recession by providing a number of charts or plots to visualize the data and make it easy for the directors to understand my analysis. The secondary task the directors requested was for me to create suitable dashboards with added user interactions to contain my plots and charts, and thus provide them with the ability to select a particular report for a period of time & discuss the data in detail.
